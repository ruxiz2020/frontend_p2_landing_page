# Coding

This Website has borrowed design pattern from several templates on [website-templates](https://github.com/learning-zone/website-templates). It is a clean and simple One Page HTML5 & CSS3, which is developed on HTML5 and bootstrap framework with a fully responsive style compatible with mobile and different sized devices.

This landing page contains 6 sections that is linked to the navigation bar with active styling. The 6 sections include:
* Home (header)
* Cast
* Plot & History
* Photos
* Team
* Comment (footer)

Several sections are powered by javascript animations, which include the portfolio section with photo galleries, and the header section with animated wow effect.
